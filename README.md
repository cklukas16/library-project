## SEIS 622 Class Project: Library Management System

Mengkun Du, Caitlin Klukas, Daoyu Liu 

### Summary

In this project,â€¯we are going to build a mock library management system. This system allows visitors to browse the booklist, create user accounts, and borrow available books. In addition, administrators can log into admin accounts to maintain the booklist and communicate with users. 

To achieve the above requirements, this system needs a homepage and a login page to interact with users. Book keywords and user information will be sent to backend server. A search results page will display the retrieved information to users. An admin page provides an interface for administrators to maintain the booklist. 

Specifically, this system supports the following features: 

- Users can create new accounts, but admins can only login with an existing account.
- Each account will save basic information like username and email address. 
- Admins can add a booklist, including title, author, year, publisher, cover image, category, and number of copies. 
- Admins can modify the booklist.
- Admins can view borrowing details like book A is borrowed by user B on date C. 
- Admin and users can search and view books by title. 
- Admins can send messages to notify users. 
- Users can borrow available books by clicking the borrow button. 
- Users can return books by clicking the return button. 
- Users can view their borrowing history.

### Wireframes

This library management system has four webpages: homepage, login page, search results page, and admin page. Here are their wireframes.
