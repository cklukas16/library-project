## SEIS 622 Class Project: Library Management System

Mengkun Du, Caitlin Klukas, Daoyu Liu 

### Summary

In this project,â€¯we are going to build a mock library management system. This system allows visitors to browse the booklist, create user accounts, and borrow available books. In addition, administrators can log into admin accounts to maintain the booklist and communicate with users. 

To achieve the above requirements, this system needs a homepage and a login page to interact with users. Book keywords and user information will be sent to database and retrieve data requested. A search results page will display the retrieved information to users. An admin page provides an interface for administrators to maintain the booklist. 

Specifically, this system is planned to support the following features: 

- Admins and users can create accounts separately. 
- Each account will save basic information like username, email address, and password (safety issues should be considered). 
- Admins can add a booklist, including title, author, year, publisher, cover image, category, and number of copies. 
- Admins can modify the booklist. 
- Admins can view borrowing status like available, borrowed, and expired. 
- Admins can view borrowing details like book A is borrowed by user B on date C. 
- Admin and users can search and view books by title, author, and category. 
- Admins and users can send messages or notifications to each other. 
- Users can borrow available books by clicking the borrow button. 
- Users can extend the return date by clicking the extend button. 
- Users can return books by clicking the return button. 
- Users can view their borrowing history. 

### Wireframes

This library management system has four webpages: homepage, login page, search results page, and admin page. Here are their wireframes.
